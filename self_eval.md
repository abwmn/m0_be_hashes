# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
1. In hashes 1, I got confused for a minute about how the symbols for foods were strings, meaning to check the value I had to enter it as a symbol and a string: 
`puts foods[:"grapes"]`
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
1. I honestly do not take any notes, and never have as a student. I spend time practicing a subject to get to know it deeply and learn through repetition.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
1. I try to solve a problem on my own with experimentation.
